        These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Georgia, excluding conflict-of-laws rules.
        If arbitration is found unenforceable for a particular claim, the state and federal courts located in
        <strong>[Fulton County], Georgia</strong> (and the Northern District of Georgia, as applicable) will have exclusive jurisdiction,
        and the parties consent to personal jurisdiction and venue there.

      <h2 class="tos-h2">23. Notices</h2>
      <p>
        Legal notices to Carrier Shark must be sent to: <strong>[Carrier Shark Legal Name, LLC, Attn: Legal, Address, City, State ZIP]</strong>
        and by email to <strong>[legal@carriershark.com]</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2 class="tos-h2">24. Assignment</h2>
      <p>
        You may not assign these Terms without Carrier Shark’s prior written consent. Carrier Shark may assign these Terms in connection with a merger,
        acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of assets.
      </p>

      <h2 class="tos-h2">25. Severability</h2>
      <p>
        If any provision is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect, and the provision will be enforced
        to the maximum extent permitted to effect the parties’ intent.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="tos-h2">26. Entire Agreement; Order Forms; Order of Precedence</h2>
      <p>
      These Terms, together with any applicable Order Form, enterprise agreement, or other written agreement signed by both parties (each, an “Order Form”), constitute the entire agreement between you and Carrier Shark regarding the Platform (the “Agreement”) and supersede all prior or contemporaneous understandings relating to the subject matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the parties execute a Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”), the DPA will govern the processing of Personal Information to the extent applicable, and in the event of a direct conflict between the DPA and these Terms, the DPA will control solely to the extent of the conflict.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      If you enter into an Order Form, the Order Form is incorporated into this Agreement by reference. In the event of a direct conflict between these Terms and a signed Order Form, the Order Form will control solely to the extent of the conflict and only with respect to the specific services covered by that Order Form.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Except as expressly stated in a signed Order Form, these Terms apply to all access to and use of the Platform.
      </p>

      <p>
      Carrier Shark may identify the applicable Terms version in system records at the time of acceptance, and such electronic records will be admissible and sufficient evidence of assent.
      </p>

      <h2 class="tos-h2">27. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      
      <p>
      Carrier Shark may modify these Terms from time to time. Updated Terms will be posted on the Platform and will indicate the revised “Last Updated” date.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      For users without an active paid subscription, changes become effective upon posting. Continued use of the Platform after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      For users with an active paid subscription governed by a signed Order Form, material changes that are reasonably adverse to the subscriber will not take effect until the next renewal term, unless the subscriber affirmatively accepts the updated Terms earlier. Non-material changes, clarifications, updates required by law, or changes that do not materially reduce subscriber rights may take effect during the current subscription term.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Carrier Shark may require users to affirmatively accept updated Terms before continuing to access certain features of the Platform.
