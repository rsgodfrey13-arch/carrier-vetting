    <h1>Built for Broker Control</h1>
    <p class="about-lead">
      Carrier Shark exists to bring structure, visibility, and operational control
      to carrier relationships inside modern freight brokerages.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 1 -->
  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>Why Carrier Shark Exists</h2>
    <p>
      Freight brokers operate in an environment where carrier authority status,
      insurance validity, documentation, and agreements directly impact risk exposure.
      Yet most workflows rely on scattered spreadsheets, inbox searches, or manual tracking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carrier Shark centralizes carrier visibility into a single system designed
      specifically for brokers — not compliance checklists, not onboarding gimmicks,
      and not generic document storage.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Focus On</h2>
    <ul class="about-list">
      <li>Carrier authority and safety visibility</li>
      <li>Insurance document tracking</li>
      <li>Broker-carrier agreement management</li>
      <li>Real-time monitoring for status changes</li>
      <li>Operational accountability</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Section 3 -->
  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <p>
      Carrier Shark is designed as infrastructure — not a marketing layer.
      Every feature is built to reduce ambiguity and increase operational clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We prioritize system integrity, structured workflows, and broker-first control.
      The goal is not to replace judgment — but to support it with better visibility.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 4 -->
  <section class="about-section about-section-muted">
    <h2>Built for Modern Brokerages</h2>
    <p>
      As freight operations become more digitized, the need for structured
      carrier oversight becomes more critical. Carrier Shark is designed to
      integrate into that environment — cleanly and intentionally.
