    <!-- 1. Overview -->
    <div class="list-card tos-body" id="overview">
      <h2 class="tos-h2">1. Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>[Carrier Shark Legal Name, LLC]</strong> (“Carrier Shark,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses,
        discloses, and retains information when you access or use our website, applications, and services (collectively, the “Platform”).
      </p>

      <div class="tos-callout">
        <strong>Scope:</strong> Carrier Shark is a business-to-business platform for U.S. and Canada-based freight brokers and related users.
        We do not knowingly offer the Platform to children under 13.
      </div>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy is designed to be read alongside our Terms of Service. If you have questions, contact us at
        <strong>[privacy@carriershark.com]</strong>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- 2. Data We Collect -->
    <div class="list-card tos-body" id="collect">
      <h2 class="tos-h2">2. Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3 class="tos-h3">2.1 Information you provide</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account and profile information:</strong> name, work email, phone number, business name, role/title, and similar business contact details you provide.</li>
        <li><strong>Transactional and workflow information:</strong> information you enter to generate, send, and manage contracts and workflows (e.g., recipient emails, routing preferences, and related metadata).</li>
        <li><strong>Documents and uploads:</strong> documents you upload or submit through the Platform (including insurance certificates and related supporting documents).</li>
        <li><strong>Support communications:</strong> content of messages you send to support, including attachments and troubleshooting details.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="tos-h3">2.2 Electronic signature and audit trail information</h3>
      <p>
        When the Platform facilitates electronic signatures, we may collect and store an audit trail associated with the signing event. This may include:
        timestamp, signer email address, document identifiers, and technical signals used to operate the workflow (such as IP address and device/browser information).
      </p>

      <h3 class="tos-h3">2.3 OCR-extracted data (convenience only)</h3>
      <p>
        The Platform may use OCR to extract information from uploaded documents (for example, insurance certificates). OCR extraction is automated and may be inaccurate,
        incomplete, or outdated. We may store the original document and associated OCR output to provide Platform functionality.
      </p>

      <h3 class="tos-h3">2.4 Information collected automatically</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Log and usage data:</strong> IP address, device identifiers, browser type, operating system, timestamps, pages/screens viewed, and actions taken in the Platform.</li>
        <li><strong>Security and integrity data:</strong> authentication events, account access history, and related signals used to protect against abuse.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> we may use essential cookies for session management and security. If we add analytics or non-essential cookies in the future, we will update this policy and provide applicable choices where required.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="tos-h3">2.5 Public and third-party data sources</h3>
      <p>
        The Platform may display information obtained from public or third-party sources (including governmental datasets such as FMCSA-related data).
        Such information is generally considered public/regulatory in nature and may be displayed to support carrier profile functionality.
      </p>

      <div class="tos-callout">
        <strong>Important:</strong> Carrier Shark is a neutral technology provider and does not verify or certify the accuracy of third-party or public datasets.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- 3. How We Use -->
    <div class="list-card tos-body" id="use">
      <h2 class="tos-h2">3. How We Use Information</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>provide, operate, maintain, and improve the Platform (including document storage, transmission, and workflow execution);</li>
        <li>facilitate electronic signature workflows and maintain associated records;</li>
        <li>perform OCR processing to enable convenience features you request or enable;</li>

    <!-- 4. Sharing -->
    <div class="list-card tos-body" id="share">
      <h2 class="tos-h2">4. How We Share Information</h2>

      <h3 class="tos-h3">4.1 Sharing with other Platform users (workflow-based)</h3>
      <p>
        The Platform is designed to transmit documents and workflow outputs to the recipients you choose. For example, when a carrier (or broker) sends an insurance
        document through the Platform, the document and related metadata may be made available to the intended recipient(s) designated in that workflow.
      </p>

      <h3 class="tos-h3">4.2 Service providers (processors)</h3>
      <p>
        We use service providers to host the Platform, store documents, process OCR, monitor reliability, and deliver notifications. These providers process information
        on our behalf under contractual obligations consistent with providing the service.
      </p>

      <h3 class="tos-h3">4.3 Legal, safety, and rights-protection</h3>
      <p>
        We may disclose information if we believe disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with law, respond to lawful requests, protect the rights and safety of
        Carrier Shark, our users, or others, or investigate suspected fraud or security issues.
      </p>

      <h3 class="tos-h3">4.4 Corporate transactions</h3>
      <p>
        If Carrier Shark is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of assets, information may be disclosed as part of that
        transaction, subject to standard confidentiality protections.
      </p>

      <div class="tos-callout">
        <strong>We do not sell personal information.</strong> We do not operate advertising profiles or ad targeting based on user behavior.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- 5. Public Carrier Profiles -->
    <div class="list-card tos-body" id="public">
      <h2 class="tos-h2">5. Public Carrier Profile Pages</h2>
      <p>
        Carrier Shark may provide public carrier profile pages that display <strong>public/regulatory information</strong> (for example, FMCSA-related data and other
        public records) to support transparency and operational workflows.
      </p>

      <div class="tos-callout">
        <strong>Document visibility:</strong> User-uploaded documents (including insurance certificates) are not intended to be publicly displayed. Such documents are
        intended for authorized workflow participants (for example, the broker recipient designated by the sender).
      </div>

      <p>
        If you believe information displayed on a public profile page is inaccurate or should not be displayed, contact us at
        <strong>[privacy@carriershark.com]</strong> with sufficient detail for us to evaluate the request.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- 6. Vendors -->
    <div class="list-card tos-body" id="vendors">

    <!-- 7. Retention -->
    <div class="list-card tos-body" id="retention">
      <h2 class="tos-h2">7. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain information for as long as reasonably necessary to provide the Platform, support your account, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes,
        and enforce agreements. Retention periods vary by data type:
      </p>

        <li><strong>Documents (including insurance uploads):</strong> generally retained while the associated account/workflow is active and for a period after account closure

    </div>

    <!-- 8. Security -->
    <div class="list-card tos-body" id="security">
      <h2 class="tos-h2">8. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information, including access controls, least-privilege practices,
        and encryption in transit. Certain signing actions may require an <strong>email-based verification code</strong> to help reduce unauthorized signing activity.
      </p>

      <p>
        No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. If you believe your account has been compromised, contact us immediately at
